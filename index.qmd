# Preface {.unnumbered}

Empirical macroeconomics often involves the analysis of time series
data, such as GDP, inflation, and interest rates, which are distinct
from those utilized in cross-sectional studies. The goal of this book is
to bridge the gap between introductory time series textbooks and
theoretical econometrics. In modern applied research, a rudimentary
comprehension of the subject often proves insufficient. Though
computational tasks can be executed through simple computer commands,
practitioners must go below the surface to understand the intricacies
and limitations of the techniques involved. However, an exhaustive
exploration of advanced econometric theories would be excessive for
practical purposes. For instance, introductory textbooks would caution
against running OLS on non-stationary time series, citing the risk of
spurious regression. Students often accept this as a rule of thumb
without a grasp of its underlying rationale. Yet, delving into intricate
topics such as It√¥ calculus is unnecessary for empirical researchers.

This book seeks to acquaint readers with the time series topics
essential for understanding and conducting empirical research, with a
focus on macroeconomic applications. In addition to introducing basic
concepts and applications, the book endeavors to elevate comprehension
to a deeper level by elucidating the "why" alongside the "what" and
"how." However, the objective is not to provide an exhaustive treatment
replete with formal proofs; rather, emphasis is placed on providing
intuitive explanations. Consequently, readers may encounter instances of
informal proofs where a more formal approach is deemed unnecessary for
applied works. This book can be read as intermediary materials between
undergraduate econometrics and more rigorous treatments of the subject,
such as Hamilton's *Time Series Analysis*.

The materials presented are drawn from or influenced by various sources,
which are listed in the References at the end of the book without being
cited individually in the context.

Regarding notations, I use lowercase letters for random variables, such
as $x_t$ and $y_t$. Realizations of random variables are expressed as
$x_1$, $x_2$, and so on. The context will make it clear whether I am
referring to a random variable or its realizations. Capital letters are
reserved for matrices, such as $A$ and $B$. Vectors and matrices are
sometimes written in bold for emphasizing, such as $\boldsymbol X$ and
$\boldsymbol y$; but mostly, in plain format, $X$ and $y$, provided that
they will not lead to confusion. Greek letters are preferred for
parameters, such as $\alpha$ and $\beta$. Estimators are indicated with
a hat, such as $\hat{\alpha}$ and $\hat{\beta}$.

I use the statistical language R whenever programming is involved. I am
aware that there are many time series solutions available in R. To avoid
burdening readers with excessive packages, I stick to base R as much as
possible with a little help from the *zoo* package.

I would like to emphasize that my knowledge and understanding of the
subject are limited, and I acknowledge that there may be mistakes or
areas where I could have provided a more accurate explanation. I deeply
appreciate any feedback or corrections from readers that could improve
the accuracy and clarity of this book.
