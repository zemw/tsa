    "section": "",
    "text": "Preface\nEmpirical macroeconomics frequently involves the analysis of time series data, encompassing variables such as GDP, inflation, and interest rates, employing methodologies distinct from those utilized in cross-sectional studies. The goal of this book is to bridge the gap between introductory time series textbooks and theoretical econometrics. In the realm of empirical research, a rudimentary comprehension of the subject matter often proves insufficient. While computational tasks can be executed through simple computer commands, practitioners must go beyond surface-level in order to understand the intricacies and limitations of the involved techniques. Conversely, an exhaustive exploration of advanced econometric theories would be excessive for practical purposes. For instance, introductory textbooks would caution against applying OLS on non-stationary time series, citing the potential risk of spurious regression. Students often accept this as a rule of thumb without a grasp of its underlying rationale. Yet, delving into intricate topics such as Itô calculus is deemed unnecessary for empirical researchers.\nThis book seeks to acquaint readers with essential time series topics crucial for understanding and conducting empirical research, with a specific focus on macroeconomic applications. In addition to introducing basic concepts and applications, such as running a regression and interpreting the result, the book endeavors to elevate comprehension to a deeper level by elucidating the “why” alongside the “what” and “how.” However, the objective is not to provide an exhaustive treatment replete with formal proofs; rather, emphasis is placed on providing intuitive explanations. Consequently, readers may encounter instances of non-rigorous proofs where a more formal approach is deemed unnecessary for an understanding required by applied works. This book can be read as intermediary materials between undergraduate econometrics and more rigorous treatments of the subject, such as Hamilton’s Time Series Analysis.\nThe materials presented are drawn from or influenced by various sources, which are listed in the References at the end of the book without being cited individually in the context. Regarding notations, I use lowercase letters for random variables, such as \\(x_t\\) and \\(y_t\\). Realizations of random variables are expressed as \\(x_1\\), \\(x_2\\), and so on. The context will make it clear whether I am referring to a random variable or its realizations. Capital letters are reserved for matrices, such as \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). Vectors and matrices are sometimes written in bold for emphasizing, such as \\(\\boldsymbol X\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol y_t\\), or in plain format as scalars if that does not lead to confusion. Greek letters are preferred for parameters, such as \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\). Estimators are indicated with a hat, such as \\(\\hat{\\alpha}\\) and \\(\\hat{\\beta}\\).\nI use the statistical language R whenever programming is involved. I am aware that there are many time series solutions available in R. To avoid burdening readers with excessive packages, I stick to base R as much as possible with a little help from the zoo package.\nI would like to emphasize that my knowledge and understanding of the subject are limited, and I acknowledge that there may be mistakes or areas where I could have provided a more accurate explanation. I deeply appreciate any feedback or corrections from readers that could improve the accuracy and clarity of this book."

    "text": "Raw data: The raw values without any transformation. We are not so interested in the raw data, as it is hard to read information from it. Take the GDP plot as an example (Figure 1.1, upper-left subplot). There is an overall upward trend. But we are more interested in: how much does the economy grow this year? Is it better or worse than last year? The answers are not obvious from the raw data. Besides, there are obvious seasonal fluctuations. Usually the first quarter has the lowest value in a whole year, due to the Spring Festival, which significantly reduces the working days in the first quarter. The seasonal fluctuations prohibit us from sensibly comparing two consecutive values.\nGrowth rate: The headline GDP growth is usually derived by comparing the current quarter with the same quarter from last year. \\(g=\\frac{x_t - x_{t-4}}{x_{t-4}}\\times 100.\\) This makes sense. As mentioned above, due to seasonal patterns, comparing two consecutive quarters directly does not make sense. The year-on-year growth rate directly tells us how fast the economy grows. However, by dividing the past values, it loses the absolute level information. For instance, it is hard to tell after the pandemic, whether or not the economy recovers from its pre-pandemic output level. Besides, it is sensitive to the values of last year. For example, due to the pandemic, the GDP for 2020 is exceptionally low, which makes growth rate for 2021 exceptionally high. This is undesirable, because it does not mean the economy in 2021 is actually good. We would like a growth rate that shirks off past burdens.\nThat’s why we sometimes prefer (annualized) quarterly growth rate. \\(g=\\frac{x_t-x_{t-1}}{x_{t-1}}\\times 400.\\) Due to seasonally patterns, two consecutive quarters are not comparable directly. A first quarter value is usually much lower than the fourth quarter of last year due to holidays, which does not necessarily mean the economy condition is getting worse. Since this pattern is the same every year, it is possible to remove the seasonal fluctuations. This is called seasonally adjustment. We won’t cover seasonally adjustment in detail, but the next section will give some intuitions on how this can possibly be done. After seasonally adjusting the time series, we can calculate the growth rate based on two consecutive values (annualized by multiplying \\(4\\)). The bottom-right panel of Figure 1.1 is the seasonally-adjusted quarterly growth. Note that it is no longer biased upward in 2021 as the YoY growth.\nSeasonally-adjusted series: This is usually the data format we prefer in time series analysis. FRED reports both seasonally-adjusted and non-seasonally-adjusted series. Seasonal adjustment algorithm is a science in itself. Popular algorithms include X-13-ARIMA developed by the United States Census Bureau, TRAMO/SEATS developed by the Bank of Spain, and so on.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Quarterly GDP Time Series (Unit: RMB Billion or %)\n\n\n\n\nLog levels and log growth rates: We like to work with log levels. A lot of economic time series exhibit exponential growth, such as GDP. Taking logs convert them to linear. Another amazing thing about logs is the difference of two log values can be interpreted as percentage growth. We know from Taylor expansion that for small values of \\(\\Delta x\\) : \\(\\ln(\\Delta x +1) \\approx \\Delta x\\). Therefore,\n\\[\n\\ln x_t - \\ln x_{t-1} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{x_t}{x_{t-1}}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{x_t-x_{t-1}}{x_{t-1}}+1\\right) \\approx \\frac{x_t-x_{t-1}}{x_{t-1}}.\n\\]\nSo it is very handy to just difference the log levels to get the growth rates. Log difference can also be interpreted as the continuously compounded rate of change, if assuming\n\\[\n\\frac{x_t}{x_{t-1}}=e^g \\implies g = \\ln x_t - \\ln x_{t-1}.\n\\]\nLog difference also has the property of summability: summing up a series of log differences gives the log level provided the initial level. It is not as handy if you want to recover the level values from a series of percentage growth.\n\\[\n\\ln x_t = x_0 + \\sum_{j=1}^{t} (\\ln x_j - \\ln x_{j-1}).\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nBuying vs. renting a home, which is better? Compute the NPV:\n\\[\n\\text{NPV}=\\sum_{t=0}^T \\frac{C_t}{(1+r)^t}=\\int_0^T C(t) e^{-rt} dt.\n\\]"

    "text": "2.1 Time Series Components\nIt is helpful to think about a time series as composed of different components: a trend component, a seasonal component, and a remainder.\n\\[x_t = T_t + S_t + R_t.\\]\nThe formula assumes the “additive” composition. This assumption is appropriate if the magnitude of the fluctuations does not vary with the absolute levels of the time series. If the magnitude of fluctuations is proportional to the absolute levels, a “multiplicative” decomposition is more appropriate:\n\\[\nx_t = T_t \\times S_t \\times R_t.\n\\]\nNote that a multiplicative decomposition of a time series is equivalent to an additive decomposition on its log levels:\n\\[\n\\ln x_t = \\ln T_t + \\ln S_t + \\ln R_t.\n\\]\nDecomposing a time series allows us to extract information that is not obvious from the original time series. It also allows us to manipulate the time series. For example, if the seasonal component can be estimated, we can remove it to obtain seasonally-adjusted series, \\(x_t^{SA} = x_t - S_t\\), or \\(x_t^{SA} = x_t/S_t\\). The question is how to estimate the components given a time series."

    "section": "2.2 Moving Averages",
    "text": "2.2 Moving Averages\nMoving averages turn out to be handy in estiming trend-cycles by averaging out noisy fluctuations. A moving average of order \\(m\\) (assuming \\(m\\) is an odd number) is defined as\n\\[\n\\text{MA}(x_t,m) = \\frac{1}{m}\\sum_{j=-k}^{k} x_{t+j},\n\\]\nwhere \\(m=2k + 1\\). For example, a moving average of order \\(3\\) is\n\\[\n\\text{MA}(x_t, 3) = \\frac{1}{3}(x_{t-1} + x_t + x_{t+1}).\n\\]\nNote that \\(x_t\\) is centered right in the middle and the average is symmetric. This also means, if we apply this formula to real data, the first and last observation will have to be discarded. If the order \\(m\\) is an even number, the formula will no longer be symmetric. To overcome this, we can estimate a moving average over another moving average. For example, we can estimate a moving average of order \\(4\\), followed by a moving average of order \\(2\\). This is denoted as \\(2 \\times 4\\)-MA. Mathematically,\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{MA}(x_t, 2 \\times 4) &= \\frac{1}{2}[\\text{MA}(x_{t-1}, 4) + \\text{MA}(x_t, 4)] \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2}\\left[\\frac{1}{4}(x_{t-2} + x_{t-1} + x_t + x_{t+1}) + \\frac{1}{4}(x_{t-1} + x_t + x_{t+1} + x_{t+2})\\right] \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{8}x_{t-2} + \\frac{1}{4}x_{t-1} + \\frac{1}{4}x_{t} + \\frac{1}{4}x_{t+1} + \\frac{1}{8}x_{t+2}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nNote that how the \\(2\\times4\\)-MA averages out the seasonality for time series with seasonal period \\(4\\), e.g. quarterly series. The formula puts equal weight on every quarter — the first and last terms refer the same quarter and their weights combined to \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\).\nIn general, we can use \\(m\\)-MA to estimate the trend if the seasonal period is an odd number, and use \\(2\\times m\\)-MA if the seasonal period is an even number.\n\ndata = readRDS(\"data/gdp.Rds\")  # a `zoo` object\ngdp2x4MA = ma(ma(data$GDP,4),2) # from `forecast` package\nts.plot(cbind(data$GDP, gdp2x4MA), col=1:2)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Quarterly GDP with 2x4-MA estimate of the trend-cycle"

It basically says the statistical properties of a time series are stable over time. Otherwise, if the statistical properties vary with time, statistics estimated from past values, such autocorrelations, would be much less meaningful. Strict stationarity requires the joint distribution being stable, that is moments of any order would be stable over time. In practice, mostly we only care about the first- and second-order moments, that is means and variances and covariances. Therefore, covariance stationary is sufficient.\nFigure 4.1 shows some examples of stationary and non-stationary time series. Only the first one is stationary (it is generated from \\(i.i.d\\) normal distribution). The second one is not stationary as its mean is not constant over time. The third one is not stationary as its variance is not constant. The last one is not stationary either, because its covariance is not constant.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1: Stationary and non-stationary time series\n\n\n\n\nReal-life time series are rarely stationary. But they can be transformed to (quasi) stationary by differencing. Figure 4.2 shows some examples of the first-order (log) differences of real-life time series. They more or less exhibit some properties of stationarity, but not perfectly stationary. The series can be further “stationarized” by taking a second-order difference. But these examples are acceptable to be treated as stationary in our models. Even if they are not perfectly stationary, the model can be thought of being used to “extract” their stationary properties.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.2: Stationary and non-stationary time series (real life)\n\n\n\n\n\nProposition 4.1 For stationary series, it holds that \\(\\gamma_k = \\gamma_{-k}\\).\n\n\nProof.

The model states that the value of \\(y_t\\) is determined by a constant, its previous value, and a random innovation. We call the last term \\(\\epsilon_t\\) innovation, not an error term. It is not an error, it is a random contribution that is unknown until time \\(t\\). It should also not be confused with the so-called “structural shock”, which is attached with a structural meaning and will be discussed in later chapters.\nThe model is probabilistic, as oppose to deterministic, in the sense that some information is unknown or deliberately omitted, so that we do not know the deterministic outcome, but only a probability distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThink about tossing a coin: if every piece of information is incorporated in the model, including the initial speed and position, the air resistance, and so on; then we can figure out the exact outcome, whether the coin will land on its head or tail. But this is unrealistic. Omitting all these information, we can model the process as a Bernoulli distribution. The probability model will not give a deterministic outcome, but only a distribution with each possible value associated with a probability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe assumption that a process is only determined by its past values and a white noise innovation seems very restrictive. But it is not. Think about the three assumptions for technical analysis of the stock market (there are still many investors believing this): (1) The market discounts everything, (2) prices move in trends and counter-trends, and (3) price action is repetitive, with certain patterns reoccurring. Effectively, it is saying we can predict the stock market by the past price patterns. If we were to write a model for the stock market based on these assumptions, AR(\\(p\\)) isn’t a bad choice at all.\n\n\nNote that the model can be rewritten as\n\\[\ny_t - \\frac{\\mu}{1-\\phi} = \\phi\\left(y_{t-1} - \\frac{\\mu}{1-\\phi}\\right) + \\epsilon_t,\n\\]\nassuming \\(\\phi\\neq 1\\). If we define \\(\\tilde{y_t}=y_t - \\frac{\\mu}{1-\\phi}\\), we can get rid of the constant term:\n\\[\n\\tilde{y}_t = \\phi\\tilde{y}_{t-1} + \\epsilon_t.\n\\tag{6.2}\\]\nIt can be easily shown, if \\(y_t\\) is stationary, \\(\\frac{\\mu}{1-\\phi}\\) is the stationary mean. Because this mechanical transformation can always be done to remove the constant. We can simply ignore the constant term without lost of generality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWorking with demeaned variables greatly simplify the notation. For example, assuming \\(\\mathbb{E}(y_t)=0\\), the variance is simply the second-order moment \\(\\mathbb{E}(y_t^2)\\); the covariance can be written as \\(\\mathbb{E}(y_ty_{t-k})\\).\n\n\nFor a constant-free AR(1) model, we can rewrite the model as follows:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\ny_t &= \\phi y_{t-1} + \\epsilon_t \\\\\n&= \\phi( \\phi y_{t-2} + \\epsilon_{t-1}) + \\epsilon_t \\\\\n&= \\phi^2 y_{t-2} + \\phi\\epsilon_{t-1} + \\epsilon_t \\\\\n&= \\phi^2 (\\phi y_{t-3} + \\epsilon_{t-2}) + \\phi\\epsilon_{t-1} + \\epsilon_t \\\\\n&= \\phi^3 y_{t-3} + \\phi^2\\epsilon_{t-2} + \\phi\\epsilon_{t-1} + \\epsilon_t \\\\\n&\\;\\vdots \\\\\n&= \\phi^t y_0 + \\sum_{j=0}^{t-1} \\phi^j\\epsilon_{t-j} \\\\\n&= \\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} \\phi^j\\epsilon_{t-j}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{6.3}\\]\nThe exercise shows an AR(1) process can be reduced to an MA process, which will be discussed in the next section. It says the value of \\(y_t\\) is determined by its initial value (if it has one) and the accumulated innovations in the past. It is our deeds in history that shapes our world today.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe property that an AR process can be rewritten as an infinite MA process with absolute summable coefficients \\(\\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty}|\\phi^j|<\\infty\\) is called causal. This must not be confused with the causal effect in econometrics (defines in the ceteris paribus sense). To avoid confusion, we avoid use this term as much as possible.\n\n\nNow we focus our attention on the critical parameter \\(\\phi\\). If \\(|\\phi|>1\\), the process is explosive. We are not interested in explosive processes. If a real-world time series grows exponentially, we take logarithm to transform it to linear. So in most of our discussions, we rule out the case of explosive behaviour.\nIf \\(|\\phi|<1\\), \\(\\phi^j\\to 0\\) as \\(j\\to\\infty\\). This means the influence of innovations far away in the past decays to zero. We will show that the series is stationary and ergodic.\nIf \\(|\\phi|=1\\), we have \\(y_t = \\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} \\text{sgn}(\\phi)^j\\epsilon_{t-j} = \\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty}\\tilde{\\epsilon}_{t-j}\\). This means the influence of past innovations will not decay no matter how distant away they are. This is known as a unit root process, which will be covered in later chapters. But it is clear that the process is not stationary. Consider the variance of \\(y_t\\) conditioned on an initial value:\n\\[\n\\text{var}(y_t|y_0) = \\text{var}(\\sum_{j=0}^{t-1}\\epsilon_{t-j})=\\sum_{j=0}^{t-1}\\text{var}(\\epsilon_{t-j})=\\sum_{j=0}^{t-1}\\sigma^2=t\\sigma^2.\n\\]\nThe variance is increasing with time. It is not constant.

By Definition 4.2, the process is covariance stationary.\n\nSo the ACF decays gradually as \\(\\phi^j \\to 0\\). What about the PACF? Estimating the PACF is equivalent to regressing \\(y_t\\) on its lags.

    "text": "7.1 MA(1) Process\nAgain, let’s start with the simplest moving average model. A first-order moving average process, or MA(1), is defined as\n\\[\ny_t = \\mu + \\epsilon_t + \\theta\\epsilon_{t-1},\n\\tag{7.1}\\]\nwhere \\(\\{\\epsilon_t\\} \\sim \\text{WN}(0, \\sigma^2)\\) are uncorrelated innovations. The MA model says the current value \\(y_t\\) is a moving average of past innovations (in MA(1), the weight on \\(\\epsilon_{t-1}\\) is \\(\\theta\\)). MA models directly relate the observable variable to past innovations. If we know the past innvation \\(\\epsilon_{t-j}\\), we can easily figure out its contribution to the outcome variable (unlike AR models where the effect of a past innovation is transmitted through \\(y_{t-j},\\dots,y_{t-1}\\)). So MA models are the preferred analytic tool in many applications, despite it looks odd from the eyes of regression modelers. You may wonder how it is possible to estimate such a model. We will put off the estimation techniques to the next chapter.\nIt is clear that \\(y_t\\) has a constant mean, \\(\\mathbb{E}(y_t) = \\mu\\). We can omit the constant if we work with the demeaned series \\(\\tilde{y}_t = y_t - \\mu\\). Without loss of generality, we assume for the rest \\(\\{y_t\\}\\) has zero mean, so the model is simplified as\n\\[\ny_t = \\epsilon_t + \\theta\\epsilon_{t-1}.\n\\tag{7.2}\\]\nLet’s compute its variance and covariances:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\gamma_0 &= \\text{var} (\\epsilon_t + \\theta\\epsilon_{t-1}) = \\text{var}(\\epsilon_t) + \\theta^2\\text{var}(\\epsilon_{t-1}) = (1+\\theta^2)\\sigma^2;\\\\\n\\gamma_1 &= \\text{cov}(y_t, y_{t-1}) = \\text{cov}(\\epsilon_{t} + \\theta\\epsilon_{t-1}, \\epsilon_{t-1} + \\theta\\epsilon_{t-2}) = \\text{cov} (\\theta\\epsilon_{t-1}, \\epsilon_{t-1} + \\theta\\epsilon_{t-2}) = \\theta\\sigma^2; \\\\\n\\gamma_2 &= \\text{cov}(y_t, y_{t-2}) = \\text{cov}(\\epsilon_{t} + \\theta\\epsilon_{t-1}, \\epsilon_{t-2} + \\theta\\epsilon_{t-3}) = 0; \\\\\n&\\vdots\\\\\n\\gamma_j &= 0 \\text{ for } |j|\\geq 2.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nIt is clear that the MA(1) process is stationary. And the ACF cuts off after the first lag. Because more distant lags \\(y_{t-k}\\) are constituted by even more distant innovations \\(\\epsilon_{t-k}, \\epsilon_{t-k-1}, ...\\) which has no relevance for \\(y_t\\) given the MA(1) structure.\nWe have seen AR processes are equivalent to MA(\\(\\infty\\)) processes. Similar results hold for MA models. Rewrite the MA(1) process with the lag operator, assuming \\(|\\theta| < 1\\),\n\\[\ny_t = (1 + \\theta L) \\epsilon_t \\Leftrightarrow\n(1+\\theta L)^{-1} y_t = \\epsilon_t \\Leftrightarrow\n\\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} (-\\theta)^j y_{t-j} = \\epsilon_t.\n\\]\nThat means an MA(1) is equivalent to an AR(\\(\\infty\\)) process if \\((1+\\theta L)\\) is invertible. This shows AR and MA are really the same family of models. The model AR or MA is chosen by parsimonious principle. For example, an AR model with many lags can possibly be modeled by a parsimonious MA model.\nSince an MA(1) is equivalent to some AR(\\(\\infty\\)) process, the PACF of an MA(1) should tail off gradually.\n\ny = arima.sim(list(ma=0.8), n=2000)\npar(mfrow=c(1,2), mar=c(1,4,1,1))\nacf(y); pacf(y)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.1: ACF and PACF of MA(1) process\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvertibility\n\n\n\nIf \\(|\\theta|>1\\), \\(\\theta(L)\\) is not invertible.

For non-invertible MA process, as long as \\(\\theta(L)\\) avoids unit root, we can always find an invertible process that shares the same ACF. This means, for a stationary MA process, it makes no harm to just assume it is invertible."

Therefore, with long enough lags, any covariance-stationary process can be approximated arbitrarily well by ARMA models. This is a very bold conclusion to make. It sets up the generality of ARMA models, which makes it one of the most important theorems in time series analysis.\n\nTheorem 9.1 (Wold Decomposition Theorem) Every covariance-stationary time series \\(y_t\\) can be written as the sum of two time series, one deterministic and one stochastic. Formally,\n\\[\ny_t = \\eta_t + \\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} b_j\\epsilon_{t-j},\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\eta_t \\in I_{-\\infty}\\) is a deterministic time series (such as one represented by a sine wave); \\(\\epsilon_t\\) is an uncorrelated innovation sequence with \\(\\mathbb{E}[\\epsilon_t]=0\\), \\(\\mathbb{E}[\\epsilon_t\\epsilon_{t-j}]=0\\) for \\(j\\neq 0\\); and \\(\\{b_j\\}\\) are square summable, \\(\\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty}|b_j|^2<\\infty\\).\n\n\nProof. We will prove the theorem by constructing the innovation sequence \\(\\{e_t\\}\\) and showing it satisfies the conditions stated. Let \\(e_t = y_t - \\hat{\\mathbb{E}}(y_t|I_{t-1}) = y_t - a(L)y_{t-1}\\), where \\(\\hat{\\mathbb{E}}(y_t|I_{t-1})\\) is the best linear predictor (BLP) of \\(y_t\\) based on information set at \\(t-1\\). \\(a(L)\\) does not depend on \\(t\\) because \\(y_t\\) is covariance stationary. As the best linear predictor, \\(a(L)\\) solves\n\\[\\min_{\\{a_j\\}} \\mathbb{E} (y_t - \\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty}a_jy_{t-j})^2.\\] The first-order conditions with respect to \\(a_j\\) gives\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbb{E}[y_{t-j}(y_t-\\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty}a_jy_{t-j})] &= 0, \\\\\n\\implies \\mathbb{E}[y_{t-j}e_t] &=0.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nWe now verify that \\(e_t\\) satisfies the white noise conditions. Without loss of generality, we may assume \\(\\mathbb{E}(y_t)=0\\), it follows that \\(\\mathbb{E}(e_t)=0\\). \\(\\text{var}(e_t)=\\mathbb{E}(y_t-a(L)y_t)^2\\) is a function of covariance of \\(y_t\\) and \\(a_j\\), none of which varies with time. So \\(\\text{var}(e_t)=\\sigma^2\\) is constant. Utilizing the first-order condition, \\(\\mathbb{E}[e_te_{t-j}] = \\mathbb{E}[e_t(y_{t-j}-a(L)y_{t-j})] = 0.\\)\nRepeatedly substituting for \\(y_{t-k}\\) gives\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\ny_t &= e_t + \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} a_ky_{t-k} \\\\\n&= e_t + a_1(e_{t-1} + \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} a_ky_{t-1-k}) + \\sum_{k=2}^{\\infty} a_ky_{t-k}\\\\\n&= e_t + a_1 e_{t-1} + \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\tilde{a}_ky_{t-k-1} \\\\\n&= e_t + a_1 e_{t-1} + \\eta_t^1 \\\\\n&\\quad\\vdots\\\\\n&= \\sum_{j=0}^{k} c_j e_{t-j} + \\eta_t^k,\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] where \\(\\eta_t^k \\in I_{t-k-1}\\). As \\(k\\to\\infty\\), we have \\(v_t = y_t - \\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty}c_je_{t-j} \\in I_{-\\infty}\\).\n\nLet’s appreciate this theorem for a while. The property of stationarity can be loosely understood as having stable patterns over time. The Wold Theorem states that any such patterns can be captured by ARMA models. In other words, ARMA models are effective in modelling stable patterns repeated over time, in so far as only 2nd-order moments are of concern. Even if the time series is not entirely stationary, if we model it with ARMA, it can be thought as extracting the stationary patterns.

    "text": "9.2 Causality and Invertibility*\nWe have seen that AR models can be rewritten as MA models and vice versa, suggesting the ARMA representation of a stochastic process is not unique. We have also seen that a non-invertible MA process can be equivalently represented by an invertible MA process. For example, the following MA(1) processes have the same ACF:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nx_t &= w_t + \\frac{1}{5} w_{t-1}, & w_t\\sim\\text{WN}(0,25);\\\\\ny_t &= v_t + 5 v_{t-1}, & v_t\\sim\\text{WN}(0, 1).\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe same property holds for AR processes. In Chapter 6, we state that an AR(1) process is explosive if \\(|\\phi|>1\\). This is not entirely rigorous. Consider an AR(1) process,\n\\[\ny_t = \\phi y_{t-1} + \\epsilon_t, \\text{ where } |\\phi| > 1.\n\\]\nMultiply both sides by \\(\\phi^{-1}\\),\n\\[\n\\phi^{-1} y_t = y_{t-1} + \\phi^{-1}\\epsilon_t,\n\\]\nRewrite it as an MA process,\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\ny_t &= \\phi^{-1} y_{t+1} - \\phi^{-1}\\epsilon_{t+1} \\\\\n&= \\phi^{-1} (\\phi^{-1} y_{t+2} - \\phi^{-1}\\epsilon_{t+2}) - \\phi^{-1}\\epsilon_{t+1} \\\\\n&\\;\\vdots \\\\\n&= \\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty} -\\phi^{-j}\\epsilon_{t+j}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nGiven \\(|\\phi^{-1}|<1\\), the process is stationary, expressed as discounted innovations in the future (despite this looks quite odd). In fact, for an non-causal AR process, we can find a causal AR process that generates the same ACF (remember the term causal means an AR process can be converted to an MA process with absolute summable coefficients).\nThe problem is given an ARMA equation, it is not enough to uniquely pin down a stochastic process. Both the explosive process and the stationary process can be a solution to \\(y_t = \\phi y_{t-1} + \\epsilon_t\\). But for a stationary process expressed as an AR model with \\(|\\phi|>1\\), we can always find an AR(1) process with \\(|\\tilde\\phi|<1\\) and a different white noise sequence \\(\\{\\tilde\\epsilon_t\\}\\) that generate the same ACF.\nThe following theorems state the conditions for the existence of stationary solutions, and the possibility of rewriting non-causal or non-invertible ARMA representations as causal and invertible ones. Since it is always possible to do so, it loses nothing to stick with causal and invertible ARMA processes when modelling stationary time series.\n\nTheorem 9.2 A unique stationary solution to the ARMA process \\(\\phi(L)y_t = \\theta(L)\\epsilon_t\\) exists iff \\(\\phi\\) and \\(\\theta\\) have no common factors and the roots of \\(\\phi(z)\\) avoid the unit circle:\n\\[\n|\\phi(z)|=1 \\implies \\phi(z) = 1-\\phi_1z-\\dots-\\phi_pz^p \\neq 0.\n\\]\n\n\nTheorem 9.3 Let \\(\\{y_t\\}\\) be a stationary ARMA process defined by \\(\\phi(L)y_t = \\theta(L)\\epsilon_t\\). If the roots of \\(\\theta(z)\\) avoid unit circle, then there are polynomials \\(\\tilde{\\phi}\\) and \\(\\tilde\\theta\\) and a white noise sequence \\(\\tilde\\epsilon\\) such that \\(\\{y_t\\}\\) satisfies \\(\\tilde\\phi(L)y_t = \\tilde\\theta(L)\\tilde\\epsilon_t\\), and this is a causal and invertible ARMA process."

The other is to explain the concept of dynamic causal effect. We join the two topics in one chapter because both of them can be done via a regression framework. Maximum likelihood estimation plays a pivotal role in estimating time series models. Nonetheless, starting with OLS always make things easier. We start with a quick review of the basic OLS concepts that are familiar to any students in econometrics, that is the regressions applied to cross-sectional \\(iid\\) observations. We then extend it to time series data. We will see it is not as straightforward as one might expect, as intertemporal dependencies between observation need additional treatment. In the second half of the chapter, we will explain the concept of dynamic causal effect, that is the causal effect of an intervention on outcome variables. Similar to cross-sectional studies, we need to define the causal effect relative to counterfactuals. With time series data, the counterfactuals have to be defined across time rather across individuals."

Given all stationary time series can be approximated by ARMA processes, it makes sense to model a stationary time series with ARMA, and then make forecast based on that model. We will see our heuristic solutions in the first part can be easily justified with the theory of BLP.\n\n13.3.1 Forecasting with AR(p)\nWe have said that, for an AR(\\(p\\)) process\n\\[\ny_t = \\phi_1 y_{t-1} + \\phi_2 y_{t-2} + \\dots + \\phi_p y_{t-p} + \\epsilon_t,\n\\]\nThe one-step-ahead forecast is simply\n\\[\n\\hat y_{T+1|T} = \\phi_1 y_{T} + \\phi_2 y_{T-1} + \\dots + \\phi_p y_{T-p+1}.\n\\]\nThis is the BLP immediately from Property 2 of Proposition 13.1.

Also note that for the values readily observed: \\(y_T, y_{T-1},...\\) , the BLP is the value itself.\n\n\n13.3.2 Forecasting with MA(q)\nFor the MA(\\(q\\)) process\n\\[\ny_t = \\epsilon_t + \\theta_1\\epsilon_{t-1} + \\theta_2\\epsilon_{t-2} + \\cdots + \\theta_q\\epsilon_{t-q}  \n\\]\nThe BLP for \\(h\\)-step-ahead forecast is (assuming \\(h<q\\))\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\hat y_{T+h|T} &= \\mathcal{F}(y_{T+h}|\\epsilon_T,\\epsilon_{T-1}...) \\\\\n&= \\mathcal{F}(\\epsilon_{T+h}|\\epsilon_T,\\epsilon_{T-1}...) + \\theta_1\\mathcal{F}(\\epsilon_{T+h-1}|\\epsilon_T,\\epsilon_{T-1}...) + \\cdots + \\theta_q\\mathcal{F}(\\epsilon_{T+h-q}|\\epsilon_T,\\epsilon_{T-1}...) \\\\\n&= 0 + \\cdots + 0 + \\theta_h\\epsilon_T + \\cdots + \\theta_q\\epsilon_{T+h-q}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nWe make use of Property 3 of Proposition 13.1 with the knowledge that \\(\\text{cov}(\\epsilon_i,\\epsilon_j)=0\\) for \\(i \\neq j\\). This result is also consistent with our intuition, because we have no knowledge of future innovations, the best thing we can do is assuming they are zeros. If \\(h>q\\), then all \\(\\mathcal{F}(\\epsilon_{T+h-q}|\\epsilon_T,\\epsilon_{T-1}...)\\) are zero, which yields \\(\\hat y_{T+h|T} = 0\\).\nIn practice, we do not observe \\(\\{\\epsilon_{t}\\}\\). If we have an estimated MA model and we want to make forecast based on the model, we need to back out \\(\\{\\epsilon_{t}\\}\\) from \\(\\{y_t\\}\\) by inverting the MA process: \\(\\epsilon_t = \\theta^{-1}(L)y_t\\).\nWith the MA specification, we can easily compute the Mean Squared Forecast Error (MSFE) as follows\n\\[\nQ_{T+h|T} = \\mathbb{E}(y_{T+h} - \\hat y_{T+h|T})^2 = \\mathbb{E}\\left(\\sum_{j=0}^{h-1}\\theta_j\\epsilon_{T+h-j}\\right)^2 = \\sigma^2\\sum_{j=0}^{h-1}\\theta_j^2.\n\\]\n\n\n13.3.3 Forecasting with ARMA(p,q)\nConsider the ARMA(\\(p\\), \\(q\\)) process\n\\[\n(1-\\phi_1L-\\cdots-\\phi_pL^p)y_t = (1+\\theta_1L+\\cdots+\\theta_qL^q)\\epsilon_t\n\\]\nWe assume the process is causal and invertible. We can transform it to an AR(\\(\\infty\\)) process or MA(\\(\\infty\\)) process.\nCausal form:\n\\[\ny_t = \\phi^{-1}(L)\\theta(L)\\epsilon_t = \\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} \\psi_j\\epsilon_{t-j}\n\\]\nInvertible form:\n\\[\n\\epsilon_t = \\theta^{-1}(L)\\phi(L)y_t = \\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} \\pi_j y_{t-j}\n\\]\nor\n\\[\ny_t = -\\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty} \\pi_j y_{t-j} + \\epsilon_t\n\\]\nAs we have seen so far, it is relatively easier to compute the mean forecast with AR models, and the MSFE with MA models. So we make forecast with the AR representation:\n\\[\n\\hat y_{T+h|T} = -\\sum_{j=1}^{h-1}\\pi_j\\hat y_{T+h-j} - \\sum_{j=h}^{\\infty}\\pi_jy_{T+h-j}\n\\]\nHowever, we do not observe infinite past values in real world. We can only use the truncated values, discarding past values that we do not observe \\(y_0,y_{-1}, y_{-1},...\\)\n\\[\n\\hat y_{T+h|T} = -\\sum_{j=1}^{h-1}\\pi_j\\hat y_{T+h-j} - \\sum_{j=h}^{T+h-1}\\pi_jy_{T+h-j}\n\\]\nWe compute the MSFE with the MA representation:\n\\[\nQ_{T+h|T} = \\mathbb{E}(y_{T+h} - \\hat y_{T+h})^2 =  \\sigma^2\\sum_{j=0}^{h-1}\\psi_j^2\n\\]\nIf we can compute the prediction interval if we assume some probability distributions for the innovations. If we assume \\(\\epsilon_t\\overset{iid}\\sim N(0, \\sigma^2)\\), then \\((y_1,...,y_{T+h})'\\) is jointly normal. Therefore,\n\\[\ny_{T+h} - \\hat y_{T+h|T} \\sim N(0, Q_{T+h|T})\n\\]\nThe prediction interval is thus given by \\(\\hat y_{T+h|T} \\pm z_{\\alpha/2}\\sqrt{Q_{T+h|T}}\\)."

    "section": "",
    "text": "As in all fields of science, we are perpetually interested in understanding the causal effect of one thing on another. In economics, we want to understand how monetary policy affects output and inflation, how exchange rate affects import and export, and so on. However, causality is something much easier said than done. In reality, there are multiple forces at work simultaneously that leads to the consequences we observed. It is challenging both conceptually and statistically to isolate the causality of a variable of particular interest.\nIn cross-sectional analysis, causality is defined counterfactually. That is, the causal effect of a treatment is defined as the difference between the treated outcome and the untreated outcome assuming that they would be otherwise the same without the treatment. In practice, that involves working with a large number of \\(iid\\) observations that are similar on average only differentiated by the status of the treatment. This approach, however, does not work well with many macroeconomic studies. For example, suppose we want to figure out the causal effect of monetary policy on inflation rate. The cross-sectional approach would entail finding a large number of almost identical countries, each with independent monetary policy. And a random subset of them tighten their monetary policies while others do not. Then we work out the different economic outcomes between these two groups. This is clearly infeasible. The question we posed concerns only one country with inflation and interest rates observed through time. We would need a definition of causal effect that encompasses observations over time not across individuals.\nSuppose \\(\\epsilon_t\\) denote a random treatment happened at time \\(t\\). Then the causal effect on an outcome variable \\(y_{t+h}\\), \\(h\\) periods ahead, of a unit shock in \\(\\epsilon\\) is defined as\n\\[\n\\mathbb{E}[y_{t+h}|\\epsilon_t=1]-\\mathbb{E}[y_{t+h}|\\epsilon_t=0].\n\\tag{14.1}\\]\nWe require the randomness of the treatment \\(\\epsilon_t\\) in a sense that it is uncorrelated with any other variables that could possible have an impact on the outcome. Therefore, \\(\\epsilon_t\\) happens or not does not affect other forces that shape the outcome. The difference in the outcomes is solely attributable to \\(\\epsilon_t\\). It is this randomness that guarantees a causal interpretation.\nOur example of monetary policy above clearly does not meet this requirement. The monetary authority does not set the interest rate randomly, but based on the economic conditions of the time, which makes it correlated with other economic variables that could also have an impact on inflation. A qualified random shock may be a change in weather conditions. Weather has huge impact on agricultural production, but it is determined independent of any human activity. If \\(\\epsilon_t\\) denotes a rainy day at time \\(t\\), and \\(y_{t+h}\\) be the agricultural production, Equation 14.1 could be a plausible causal effect. However, most variables of interest in economics are endogenously determined. How to estimate the causal effect in such cases is an art in itself. We will come back to this point later.\nThe conceptual definition of Equation 14.1 can not be computed directly as the counterfactual is not observed. What we have is a sample of experiments over time, in which the treatment happens randomly at some points but not others, \\(\\{\\epsilon_1=0, \\epsilon_2=1, \\epsilon_3=0,\\dots\\}\\). We could envision that if we have long enough observations, by comparing the outcomes when the shock happens and when it does not, it gives us an reasonable estimation of the causal effect because all other factors that contributing to the outcome, despite they are changing over time, would be averaged out provided the randomness of the treatment.\nAssuming linearity and stationarity, the causal effect of Equation 14.1 can be effectively captured by a regression framework,\n\\[\ny_{t+h} = \\theta_h\\epsilon_t + u_{t+h},\n\\]\nwhere \\(u_{t+h}\\) represents all other factors contributing to the outcome variable. Since \\(\\epsilon_t\\) is random, it holds that \\(\\mathbb{E}(u_{t+h}|\\epsilon_t) = 0\\). Therefore,\n\\[\n\\theta_h = \\mathbb{E}(y_{t+h}|\\epsilon_t=1)-\\mathbb{E}(y_{t+h}|\\epsilon_t=0).\n\\]\nThus, \\(\\theta_h\\) captures the causal effect of one unit shock of \\(\\epsilon_t\\) on \\(y_{t+h}\\). The path of the causal effects mapped out by \\(\\{\\theta_0, \\theta_1, \\theta_2, \\dots\\}\\) is called the dynamic causal effect, in a sense that it is the causal effects through time."

    "title": "15  The Structural Shock Framework",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The counterfactual framework introduced in the last section defines the dynamic causal effect of any variable on another. As economists, we are more interested in understanding the causal relationships between important forces that drive the economy. We now introduce the structural shock framework, or the Slutzky-Frisch paradigm. This paradigm is explicitly or implicitly embedded in virtually every mainstream macroeconomic models or econometric models. It is not an essential component of time series analysis. But, as we would like to approach the topic from an economist’s perspective, it is good to have this framework in mind for many of our applications.\nThe structural shock framework envisions our economy as a complex system driven by a set of fundamental structural forces and coordinated by numerous price signals that automatically balance the demand and supply of all goods and services. The structural forces could be technology progress, climate change, policy changes and so on. These structural shocks are the primitive forces underlying our economy. When a structural shock happens, it triggers a reallocation of economic resources guided by market forces. In theoretical works, we are interested in modelling the system as a whole, particularly how resources are allocated optimally by market forces. In empirical works, we are interested how to recover the underlying structural shocks and estimate their causal effect on other economic variables.\nIn the language of time series analysis, we can envision our economy as an MA process, in which the observable variables (output, employment, inflation, etc) are the outcomes of accumulated past and current structural shocks:\n\\[\n\\boldsymbol y_t = \\boldsymbol\\Theta(L) \\boldsymbol\\epsilon_t,\n\\]\nor\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\ny_{1t}\\\\ y_{2t}\\\\ \\vdots\\\\ y_{nt}\n\\end{bmatrix} =\n\\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\theta_{j,11} & \\theta_{j,12} & \\cdots & \\theta_{j,1m}\\\\\n\\theta_{j,21} & \\theta_{j,22} & \\cdots & \\theta_{j,2m}\\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n\\theta_{j,n1} & \\theta_{j,n2} & \\cdots & \\theta_{j,nm}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\epsilon_{1,t-j}\\\\ \\epsilon_{2,t-j}\\\\ \\vdots\\\\ \\epsilon_{m,t-j}\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\\(\\boldsymbol y_t\\) represents the vector of economic variables of concern. The space of \\(\\boldsymbol y_t\\) are spanned by \\(m\\) structural shocks (current and past): \\(\\{\\boldsymbol \\epsilon_{t-j}\\}_{j=0}^{\\infty}\\).\nStructural shocks are conceptual constructions that are primitive, unforeseeable, and uncorrelated underlying forces. Whether structural shocks do exist or not is an open question. But they are useful constructions that enable econometricians to disentangle different driving forces of the outcome variable.\nIn reality, almost every economic variable is endogenous. For example, monetary policy (interest rate) is set by the monetary authority based on their assessment of the economic conditions. But we can also imagine, there is a “genuine” component of the monetary policy, which may come from the personality of the policymaker and his mental conditions when he make the decision, that is not predictable from other variables. This genuine component is what we deem as the “monetary policy shock”. It is a shock in a sense that it is not predictable. It speaks for its own sake and contribute to the economic outcomes independently.\nWe do not observe the structural shocks directly. The observable variables are linear combinations of the structural shocks. For example, we may think of the observed interest rate as a linear combination of the monetary policy shock together with supply-side shocks and others.\n\\[\ni_t = \\theta_{1}(L)\\epsilon_{t}^{\\text{MP}} + \\theta_{2}(L)\\epsilon_{t}^{\\text{SS}} + \\cdots\n\\]\nTherefore, regressing inflation or output on interest rate will not give the causal effect of the monetary policy. Because interest rate does not represent the “genuine” monetary policy shock. It is determined by other economic variables and there are multiple structural forces at work. There are numerous literature that works on methods to isolate the “monetary policy shock” from the observed interest rates. Such way of constructing the structural shocks is not only a conceptual idea, but also a prerequisite for meaningful interpretation of the coefficients of econometric models."

So HAC standard errors are required for robust inferences.\n\nProposition 16.1 Assumptions for a consistent estimation of dynamic causal effects with distributed lag models:\n\n\\(\\epsilon\\) is an exogenous shock, \\(\\mathbb E(u_t|\\epsilon_t,\\epsilon_{t-1},...)=0\\);\nAll variables are stationary;\nRegular conditions for OLS to work.\n\n\nTo reduce the serial correlations \\(\\{u_t\\}\\), and also allow for slow adjustment of \\(y_t\\), we can also include lagged dependent variables in the specification, which becomes an autoregressive distributed lag (ADL) specification:\n\\[\ny_t = \\phi_1 y_{t-1} + \\cdots + \\phi_p y_{t-p} + \\beta_0\\epsilon_t + \\beta_1\\epsilon_{t-1} + \\cdots + \\beta_p\\epsilon_{t-p} + u_t,\n\\]\nor\n\\[\n\\phi(L) y_t = \\beta(L) \\epsilon_t + u_t.\n\\]\nWhen lags of the dependent variable are included as regressors, strict exogeneity fails for sure, because \\(X=\\{y_{t-1},\\dots,\\epsilon_t, \\epsilon_{t-1},\\dots\\}\\) is correlated with past errors \\(u_{t-1}\\), despite it is uncorrelated with the contemporary error \\(u_t\\). The OLS is consistent so long as \\(\\{u_t\\}\\) are not serially correlated. Otherwise, \\(u_t\\) would be correlated with \\(X\\) through \\(u_{t-1}\\). The serial correlation can be tested with Durbin-Watson test or Breusch-Godfrey test.\nThe dynamic causal effect is more convoluted with the ADL specification though,\n\\[\n\\hat\\theta(L) = \\hat\\phi^{-1}(L) \\hat\\beta(L).\n\\]\nADL also require truncated lags. \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are chosen as an increasing function of the sample size.

    "text": "16.4 Example of Constructed Structural Shocks\nMost structural shocks in economics are not directly observed, such as monetary policy shocks, or fiscal policy shocks, yet they are of profound interest of researchers. As we have explained before, regressing output or inflation on interest rate does not give a plausible estimation of the causal effect of monetary policy, due to the endogeneity problem. Thus, we need to isolate the exogenous part of the monetary policy from observed variables. The method to achieve this is an active research field in itself. We here demonstrate the monetary policy shock for China constructed by Das and Song (2023).\nThe authors utilize the high-frequency price changes of interest rate swap around the window of monetary policy announcement to approximate the monetary policy shock. The rationale of this construction is that, the price of the financial instrument reflects the expected interest rate by market participants based on the economic conditions. Therefore, the sudden change of the price in the tiny window of monetary policy announcement captures the unexpected part of the monetary policy.\n\nlibrary(zoo)\n\nmp = readRDS(\"data/mpshocks.Rds\") # monetary policy shock\nmd = readRDS(\"data/md.Rds\") # monthly data\n\nplot(na.exclude(cbind(mp$shock_1y, md$LoanRate1Y)), \n     main=\"\", xlab=\"\", ylab=c(\"Loan Rate\", \"MP Shock\"))\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16.3: Monetary Policy Shock and Lending Rate\n\n\n\n\nWe estimate the dynamic causal effect of monetary policy shock on inflation using the constructed MP shocks. It shows that a tightening of monetary policy implies a gradual cooling down of inflation. The price level starts to decline roughly half a year after the initial tightening shock. However, the confidence interval is wide, suggesting an insignificant estimation of the policy effect. The result does not provide very strong evidence underlining the effectiveness of monetary policy to control inflation.\n\nsample = na.exclude(cbind(cpi=md$CPI, mp))\n\n# distributed lag model\nmod = dynlm(cpi ~ L(shock_1y, 0:12), sample)\n# confidence interval\nci = coefci(mod, vcov. = NeweyWest)\n\n# plot dynamic multiplier\n{\n  plot(mod$coefficients[-1], # remove intercept\n       type = \"l\", \n       col = 2, \n       ylim = c(-1,1.5), \n       xlab = \"Lag\", \n       ylab = \"Dynamic Multiplier\")\n  abline(h = 0, lty = 2)\n  lines(ci[-1,1], col = 4)\n  lines(ci[-1,2], col = 4)\n}\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16.4: Dynamic response of inflation on monetary policy shocks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStock, James H, and Mark W Watson. 2020.

    "text": "If a structural shock is not directly observable, neither can it be constructed through observable variables, we can identify it using an instrument variable approach if an instrument is available.\nSuppose our observable space \\(\\boldsymbol y=(y_1,y_2,\\dots)'\\) is spanned by multiple structural shocks \\(\\epsilon = (\\epsilon_1,\\epsilon_2,\\dots)'\\). We want to identify the causal effect of structural shock \\(\\epsilon_1\\). An instrument variable \\(z\\) satisfies the following conditions:\n\n\\(\\mathbb E(\\epsilon_{1t}z_t) =\\alpha\\neq 0\\) (relevance);\n\\(\\mathbb E(\\epsilon_{2:n}z_t) = 0\\) (contemporaneous exogeneity);\n\\(\\mathbb E(\\boldsymbol\\epsilon_{t+j}z_t) = 0\\) for \\(j\\neq 0\\) (lead-lag exogeneity).\n\n\\(\\epsilon_{2:n}\\) denotes all other structural shocks except \\(\\epsilon_1\\). The lead-lag exogeneity is unique to time series. To understand this, consider an local projection: \\(y_{t+h} = \\theta_h\\epsilon_t +u_{t+h}\\). As illustrated in the last section, \\(u_{t+h}\\) is a linear combination of the entire history of structural shocks. If \\(z_t\\) is to identify the causal effect of shock \\(\\epsilon_{1t}\\) alone, it must be uncorrelated with all leads and lags. The requirement that \\(z_t\\) be uncorrelated with future \\(\\epsilon\\)’s is generally not restrictive — by definition, future shocks are unanticipated. To the contrary, the requirement that \\(z_t\\) be uncorrelated with past \\(\\epsilon\\)’s is more restrictive and hard to meet.\nSuppose we want to estimate the causal effect of \\(\\epsilon_{1,t}\\) on \\(y_{2,t+h}\\), where \\(\\epsilon_{1,t}\\) is only observable through \\(y_{1,t}\\). Suppose we have an instrument variable \\(z_t\\) that satisfies the above conditions. The local projection\n\\[\ny_{2,t+h} = \\theta_{h,21} y_{1,t} + u_{t+h}\n\\]\ncannot be consistently estimated because \\(y_{1,t}\\) and \\(u_{t+h}\\) are correlated. However, with the help with \\(z_t\\) as an instrument, we can consistently estimate the dynamic multiplier \\(\\theta_{h,21}\\):\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\beta_{\\text{LP-IV}} &= \\frac{\\mathbb E(y_{2,t+h}z_t)}{\\mathbb E(y_{1,t}z_t)}\\\\\n&= \\frac{\\mathbb E[(\\theta_{h,21}y_{1,t} + u_{t+h})z_t]}{\\mathbb E(y_{1,t}z_t)}\\\\\n&= \\frac{\\theta_{h,21}\\alpha}{\\alpha} = \\theta_{h,21}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nLead-lag exogeneity implies \\(z_t\\) being unforecastable in a regression of \\(z_t\\) on lags of \\(y_t\\). If the exogeneity fails, LP-IV is not consistent. This problem can be partially addressed by including control variables in the regression:\n\\[\ny_{2,t+h} = \\theta_{h,21} y_{1,t} + \\boldsymbol{\\gamma_h'w_t} + u_{t+h}^{\\perp}.\n\\]\nWe could also include lagged values of \\(y_t\\) or other lagged variables. The IV estimator is consistent if \\(\\boldsymbol w_t\\) absorbs all past shocks that could potentially correlated with \\(z_t\\). In a broad sense, the validity of the instrument variable with additional controls requires that the controls span the space of all structural shocks."

    "text": "It is said, all stationary series are alike, but each non-stationary series is non-stationary in its own way (remember Leo Tolstoy’s famous quote: all happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.)\nIn all previous chapters, we have been working on stationary processes. We have shown that similar regression techniques and asymptotic results hold for stationary processes as for \\(iid\\) observations, albeit not exactly the same. If a time series is not stationary, we transform it to stationary by taking differences.\nThis chapter is devoted to study non-stationary time series. Special attention is given to unit root processes. We will see the theories involving non-stationary processes are entirely different from those applied to stationary processes. This makes unit root analysis an rather independent topic. The obsession with unit root in academia have faded away in recent decades (I do not know if this assessment is accurate). Despite the topic posses immense theoretical interest, it does not seem to provide proportionate value for applied studies. Nonetheless, the topic is indispensable for a comprehensive understanding of time series analysis.\nWe will focus on two types of non-stationary processes: trend-stationary processes and unit root processes, which are the most common types of non-stationary series we would encounter in economic and finance. Non-stationary series with exponential growth can be transformed into linear trend, hence is not of particular interest. We will start with the relatively easy tread-stationary processes, and spend most of the paragraphs on unit root processes.\nWe start by pointing out that, it is very dangerous to blindly include non-stationary variables in a regression. To illustrate this, we simulate two random walks:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nx_{t} &= x_{t-1} + \\epsilon_{t},\\quad\\epsilon_{t}\\overset{iid}\\sim N(0,\\sigma_X^2)\\\\\ny_{t} &= y_{t-1} + \\eta_{t},\\quad\\eta_{t}\\overset{iid}\\sim N(0,\\sigma_Y^2)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\\(\\epsilon_t\\) and \\(\\eta_t\\) are independent to each other.\n\nset.seed(2024)\nx = cumsum(rnorm(200))\ny = cumsum(rnorm(200))\nts.plot(cbind(x,y), col=1:2)\n\n\n\n\nWe would expect the two series completely uncorrelated, as they are two independent random processes. However, if we regress \\(y_t\\) on \\(x_t\\), we would likely find a very strong correlation. This is called a spurious regression.\n\\[\ny_t = \\alpha + \\beta x_t + u_t\n\\]\n\ncoeftest(lm(y ~ x))\n\n\nt test of coefficients:\n\n             Estimate Std.

That means we would much more likely to find significant results with spurious regression.\n\n# Monte Carlo simulation\ntvalue = sapply(1:1000, function(i) {\n  x = cumsum(rnorm(200))\n  y = cumsum(rnorm(200))\n  # extract t-value\n  summary(lm(y~x))$coef['x','t value']\n})\n# plot the density with Gaussian curve\n{\n  hist(tvalue, prob = TRUE, breaks = 40, xlim=c(-20,20), ylim = c(0,.4))\n  range = seq(-20, 20, by = .2)\n  lines(range, dnorm(range), col = 2)\n}\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, the conventional statistical inference against non-stationary series is totally misleading.

    "text": "21.2 Some properties\nThe quadratic variation is one of the most important properties of Brownian motions. Intuitively, it says the squared tiny changes sum up to a constant with probability \\(1\\) no matter which realized path it takes. Smooth functions will not have such property, because \\((dX)^2\\) diminishes much faster than \\(dX\\), surely we get \\(\\int_0^t(dX)^2 =0\\). Because Brownian motion fluctuations too much, the squared changes do not diminish away. To see this, imagine summing up the squares of infinitely many small increments up to \\(t\\):\n\\[\n\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\sum_{i=1}^{nt}\\left[\n  X\\left(\\frac{i}{n}\\right) - X\\left(\\frac{i-1}{n}\\right)\n  \\right]^2 = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\sum_{i=1}^{nt}\\epsilon_i^2,\n\\]\nwith \\(\\epsilon_i\\sim N\\left(0,\\frac{1}{n}\\right)\\). Therefore, \\(\\mathbb E(\\epsilon_i^2)=\\frac{1}{n}\\). Let \\(z_i = \\epsilon_i^2\\).

We use the notation \\(dW\\), but it is not the same as conventional differentials. The calculus for Brownian motions, the Itô calculus, which will be introduced below, is a different class of calculus specifically designed for stochastic functions. Before we get to that, let’s first have a look at some additional properties of Brownian motions.\nBy Central Limit Theorem, it holds that\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{nt}} W(t) = \\sqrt{nt}\\frac{1}{nt}\\sum_{i=1}^{nt}\\epsilon_i\n\\to N\\left(0,\\frac{1}{n}\\right)\n\\]\nTherefore,\n\\[\nW(t) \\sim \\sqrt{nt} N\\left(0,\\frac{1}{n}\\right) \\sim N(0,t);\n\\tag{21.3}\\]\nIt follows that, for any \\(r<s\\),\n\\[\nW(s) - W(t) \\sim N(0, s-t);\n\\tag{21.4}\\]\nAs \\(s\\) and \\(t\\) become arbitrarily close, we have\n\\[\ndW \\sim N(0, dt).\n\\tag{21.5}\\]\nIn essence, Brownian motion is the accumulation of tiny independent Gaussian innovations. We give the formal definition of Brownian motions below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrownian motion\n\n\n\nA Brownian motion (Wiener process) is a stochastic function \\(W(t)\\) such that\n\n\\(W(0)=0\\);\nFor \\(0 \\leq t \\leq s \\leq 1\\), \\(W(s)-W(t) \\sim N(0, s-t)\\);\nFor any realization, \\(W(t)\\) is continuous in \\(t\\).\n\n\n\nBrownian motions are frequently used to model stock returns. For a fixed horizon \\(T\\), the returns are normally distributed, with volatility scaled by \\(\\sqrt T\\). And the returns over different periods are independent, which means no predictability from past returns to future returns."

For an informal proof, it immediately follows from the Taylor expansion\n\\[\nF(W(t+h))-F(W(t))=F'(W(t+h)-W(t))+\\frac{1}{2}F''(W(t+h)-W(t))^2+\\cdots\n\\]\nAs \\(h\\to 0\\),\n\\[\ndF = F'dW + \\frac{1}{2}F''(dW)^2.\n\\]\nBy Equation 21.2, \\((dW)^2= dt\\). Therefore,\n\\[\ndF = F'dW + \\frac{1}{2}F''dt.\n\\]\n\nThis formula is known as the Itô’s lemma, which is the key equation of Itô calculus. Note that how this differs from the differential formula for normal functions: \\(dF = F'dW\\). The second-order term does not disappear precisely because the quadratic variation does not go to zero.\n\nExample 21.1 \\(F(W) = W^2 \\implies dF = 2WdW + dt\\)\n\n\nExample 21.2 Let’s do a more involved example to familiar ourselves with the Itô’s lemma, especially how the second-order differentiation of the Brownian motions plays out in computation.\nWe like to model the continuous-time stock price with Brownian motions. Let \\(S_t\\) be the stock price at time \\(t\\). Assume the behavior of \\(S_t\\) follows a stochastic differential equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{dS_t}{S_t}=\\mu dt + \\sigma dW\n\\]\nThat is, the percentage of \\(S_t\\) is a continuous time random walk with drift \\(\\mu\\) and volatility \\(\\sigma\\). Let’s compute the log-return of the stock over the horizon \\(T\\):\n\\[\nR_T = \\ln (S_T) - \\ln (S_0) = f(S_T)\n\\]\nApply second-order Taylor expansion:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\ndR_T &= f' dS_T + \\frac{1}{2}f'' (dS_T)^2 \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{S_T} dS_T - \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{1}{S_T^2} (dS_T)^2 \\\\\n&= \\frac{dS_T}{S_T} - \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{dS_T}{S_T}\\right)^2 \\\\\n&= (\\mu dt + \\sigma dW) - \\frac{1}{2}(\\mu dt + \\sigma dW)^2 \\\\\n&= (\\mu dt + \\sigma dW) - \\frac{1}{2}(\\mu^2 dt^2 + 2\\mu\\sigma dtdW + \\sigma^2 dW^2) \\\\\n&\\to (\\mu dt + \\sigma dW) - \\frac{1}{2} \\sigma^2 dt \\\\\n&= \\left(\\mu - \\frac{1}{2} \\sigma^2\\right) dt + \\sigma dW\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe second last step holds because, as \\(dt \\to 0\\), the terms \\(dt^2\\) and \\(dt dW\\) tend to zero faster than \\(dW^2\\). The only term left is \\(dW^2 = dt\\). If we define integral as the inverse of differentiation, we have\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nR_T = \\int_0^T dR_T &= \\left(\\mu - \\frac{1}{2} \\sigma^2\\right) \\int_0^T dt + \\sigma \\int_0^T dW \\\\\n&= \\left(\\mu - \\frac{1}{2} \\sigma^2\\right)T + \\sigma\\sqrt{T}\\epsilon_T\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\epsilon_T\\) is a standard normal variable. The model tells us that the log-return of a stock over a fixed horizon of \\(T\\) is normally distributed with mean \\((\\mu - \\sigma^2/2)T\\) and standard deviation of \\(\\sigma\\sqrt{T}\\). Everything looks familiar, except the Ito’s term, \\(\\sigma^2/2\\), which comes from the non-zero second-order differential \\(dW^2\\). The famous Black-Scholes formula for option pricing is derived from this model.\n\n\nDefinition 21.1 Stochastic integrals as the reverse operation of the stochastic differentiation. Note that we change \\(W(t)\\) to \\(W(s)\\) when it enters as the integrand.\n\n\\(\\displaystyle \\int_{0}^{t} dW = W(t)\\);\n\\(\\displaystyle F(W(t))=\\int_0^t f(W(s))dW\\) , if \\(dF = f\\ dW\\);\n\\(\\displaystyle F(t, W(t)) = \\int_0^t f(s, W(s))dW + \\int_0^t g(s, W(s))ds\\) , if \\(dF = f\\ dW + g\\ dt\\).\n\n\n\nExample 21.3 Given \\(dW^2 = 2W dW + dt\\), take integral on both sides:\n\\[\nW^2(t) = 2\\int_0^t W(s) dW + \\int_0^t ds\n\\]\n\\[\n\\implies \\int_0^t W dW = \\frac{1}{2}[W^2(t) - t].\n\\]\nSetting \\(t=1\\), it follows that\n\\[\n\\int_0^1 W dW = \\frac{1}{2}[W^2(1)-1].\n\\]\nNote that \\(W(1) \\sim N(0,1)\\). So \\(W^2(1) \\sim \\chi^2(1)\\) with expectation 1. Thus \\(\\int_0^1 W dW\\) is centered at 0 but skewed.\n\n\nExample 21.4 Given \\(d(tW) = Wdt + t\\ dW\\) (verify this with Ito’s lemma), we have\n\\[\ntW(t) = \\int_0^t W(s)ds + \\int_0^t s\\ dW\n\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\implies \\int_0^t W(s)ds &= tW(t) - \\int_0^t s\\ dW \\\\\n&=t\\int_0^t dW - \\int_0^t s\\ dW \\\\\n&=\\int_0^t (t-s) dW.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking Sense of Itô Calculus\n\n\n\nLet \\(F(t)\\) be a continuous-time trading strategy that holds an amount of \\(F(t)\\) of a stock at time \\(t\\). The stock price is a Brownian motion \\(W(t)\\). \\(dW\\) represents the movement of stock price. Consider the Itô’s integral\n\\[\nY_t = \\int_0^t F\\ dW\n\\]\nThe stochastic integral represents the payoff of the trading strategy up to time \\(t\\). Note that the integral always evaluates at the left. So the strategy can only make decision based on available information.\n\n\n\nProposition 21.1 Let \\(W(t)\\) be a Brownian motion. Let \\(f(t)\\) be a nonrandom function of time. Then\n\n\\(\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_0^t f(s)dW\\right]=0\\);\n\\(\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left(\\int_0^t f(s)dW\\right)^2\\right]=\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_0^t f^2 ds\\right]\\) (Itô isometry);\n\\(\\int_0^t f(s) dW \\sim N\\left(0, \\int_0^t f^2 ds\\right)\\).\n\n\nIf \\(f(t)\\) represents a trading strategy and the stock price follows a Brownian motion, the theorem tells us the expected payoff of this strategy is zero; more precisely, the payoff follows a Gaussian distribution.\n\nExample 21.5 Following the last example,\n\\[\n\\int_0^t W ds = \\int_0^t (t-s) dW\n\\]\n\\(f(s) = t-s\\) is a nonrandom function, apply the theorem above\n\\[\n\\text{var}\\left[\\int_0^t W ds\\right]=\\int_0^t (t-s)^2ds = \\frac{1}{3}t^3\n\\]\nTherefore,\n\\[\n\\int_0^t W(s) ds \\sim N\\left(0, \\frac{1}{3}t^3\\right).\n\\]\nThus, the integral, the area under the curve of a Brownian motion, follows a Gaussian distribution."

In this case, OLS is likely to produce spurious result: even if \\(y_{t}\\) is completely unrelated to \\(x_t\\), the estimated value of \\(\\hat\\beta\\) is likely to appear to be statistically significantly different from zero.\nSpurious regression happens when\n\nDependent/independent variables are non-stationary;\nThe residual is non-stationary for all possible values of the coefficient vector.\n\nTo understand why this happens, consider the OLS estimator:\n\\[\n\\hat b=\\begin{bmatrix}\\hat\\alpha \\\\ \\hat\\beta\\end{bmatrix} =\n\\begin{bmatrix}T & \\sum x_t \\\\ \\sum x_t & \\sum x_t^2 \\end{bmatrix}^{-1}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\\sum y_t \\\\ \\sum x_ty_t\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nTo account for different convergent speed, similar to the trend-stationary case, we multiply the estimators by a matrix,\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\\sqrt{T}^{-1} & \\\\ & 1\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\\hat\\alpha \\\\ \\hat\\beta\\end{bmatrix} &=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\\sqrt{T}^{-1} & \\\\ & 1\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}T & \\sum x_t \\\\ \\sum x_t & \\sum x_t^2 \\end{bmatrix}^{-1}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\\sqrt{T}^{-1} & \\\\ & 1\\end{bmatrix}^{-1}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\\sqrt{T}^{-1} & \\\\ & 1\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\\sum y_t \\\\ \\sum x_ty_t\\end{bmatrix} \\\\ &=\n\\begin{bmatrix}1 & T^{-3/2}\\sum x_t \\\\ T^{-3/2}\\sum x_t & T^{-2}\\sum x_t^2 \\end{bmatrix}^{-1}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\\sum T^{-3/2}y_t \\\\ T^{-2}\\sum x_ty_t\\end{bmatrix} \\\\ &\\to\n\\begin{bmatrix}1 & \\int W_X dt \\\\ \\int W_X dt & \\int W_X^2 dt\\end{bmatrix}^{-1}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\\int W_Y dt \\\\ \\int W_X W_Y dt\\end{bmatrix}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThis means, \\(\\hat\\alpha\\) actually diverges. Because it needs to be divided by \\(\\sqrt T\\) to be able to converge to a stable distribution, rather than being multiplied by a stabilizing factor. \\(\\hat\\beta\\) converges, but it is not consistent. If there is no \\(\\alpha\\), we would have\n\\[\\hat\\beta = \\frac{\\sum x_ty_t}{\\sum x_t^2}\\to\\frac{\\int W_XW_Y dt}{\\int W_X^2 dt},\\]\nwhich is inconsistent. So we won’t get zero even in very large samples.\nThe OLS estimate of the variance of \\(u_t\\) also diverges. It needs to be divided by \\(T\\) to converge:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{1}{T}\\hat\\sigma^2 &= \\frac{1}{T^2}\\sum(y_t-\\hat\\beta x_t)^2 \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{T^2}\\sum y_t^2 - 2\\hat\\beta\\frac{1}{T^2}\\sum x_ty_t + \\hat\\beta^2\\frac{1}{T^2}\\sum x_t^2 \\\\\n&\\to \\int W_Y^2 dt - 2\\hat\\beta\\int W_X W_Y dt + \\hat\\beta^2 \\int W_X^2 dt \\\\\n&\\to \\int W_Y^2 dt - \\frac{(\\int W_X W_Y dt)^2}{\\int W_X^2 dt}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe \\(t\\) or \\(F\\) statistics also diverge. \\(t\\)-stat has to be divided by \\(\\sqrt T\\) to converge; \\(F\\)-stat needs to be divided by \\(T\\) to converge.\n\\[\nt = \\frac{\\hat\\beta}{\\hat\\sigma}\\sqrt{\\sum x_t^2} =\n\\sqrt{T}\\frac{\\hat\\beta}{\\sqrt{T^{-1}\\hat\\sigma^2}}\\sqrt{T^{-2}\\sum x_t^2} \\to \\sqrt{T}\\cdot C\n\\]\nThus, as sample size \\(T\\) grows, \\(t\\)-test will appear very large and significant, despite \\(y_t\\) and \\(x_t\\) are completely independent."

    "text": "24.1 Cointegration and super-consistency\nConsider a regression with two random walks \\(x_t\\) and \\(y_t\\):\n\\[\ny_t = \\beta x_t + e_t\n\\]\nwhere \\(e_t\\) is stationary. In this case, \\(y_t\\) and \\(x_t\\) are cointegrated, because the linear combination of the two \\(I(1)\\) processes becomes \\(I(0)\\). If this is the case, we no longer have a spurious regression. In fact, \\(\\hat\\beta\\) is not only consistent, but super-consistent. Consider the OLS estimator\n\\[\nT(\\hat\\beta -\\beta) = \\frac{T^{-1}\\sum x_t e_t}{T^{-2}\\sum x_t^2}\n\\to \\frac{\\int W_1 dW_2}{\\int W_1^2 dt}.\n\\]\nNote that \\(\\int W_1 dW_2\\) is centered at zero. Hence \\(\\hat\\beta\\) is consistent, despite the distribution is non-Gaussian. It converges at rate \\(T\\), faster than the standard case \\(\\sqrt T\\). So it is called super-consistency.\nThe argument extends to general regressions with multiple regressors. As long as there exists a vector of coefficients that makes the non-stationary variables cointegrated, the OLS estimator is super-consistent. For example,\n\\[\ny_t = \\phi y_{t-1} + \\beta x_t + e_t\n\\]\nIf \\(y_t\\) is \\(I(1)\\), then \\(y_t - y_{t-1}\\) is \\(I(0)\\) (cointegrated with itself). Therefore, \\([0, 1]\\) is the cointegration vector that makes \\(e_t\\) stationary even if \\(x_t\\) is not cointegrated with \\(y_t\\). In this case, OLS estimates for \\(\\hat\\rho\\) and \\(\\hat\\beta\\) will be super-consistent.\nThe intuition of super-consistency is that OLS minimizes squared residuals. If the coefficients deviate from the cointegration vector, \\(\\hat e_t^2\\) would diverge. \\(\\hat e_t^2\\) is minimized only when the coefficients coincide with the cointegration vector. That makes OLS converges even faster.\nThe super-consistency is so strong, that the OLS estimators for cointegrated variables are consistent even when there is endogeneity problem. We demonstrate this with an example. Suppose \\(x_t\\) follows a random walk, and \\(y_t\\) cointegrates with \\(x_t\\):\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nx_t &= x_{t-1} + u_t \\\\\ny_t &= \\beta x_t + e_t\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nAssume \\(u_t\\) and \\(e_t\\) are correlated with \\(\\mathbb E (e_t^2)=\\mathbb E (u_t^2)=1\\) and \\(\\text{cov}(e_t,u_t)=1\\). For simplicity, also assume \\(e_t = \\phi u_t + \\sqrt{1-\\phi^2}\\eta_t\\) where \\(\\eta_t\\) is \\(iid\\) standard normal. As \\(e_t\\) is correlated with \\(x_t\\) through \\(u_t\\), there is clearly an endogeneity problem. The OLS estimator is given by\n\\[\nT(\\hat\\beta-\\beta) = \\frac{\\frac{1}{T}\\sum x_t e_t}{\\frac{1}{T^2}\\sum x_t^2}\n= \\frac{\\frac{1}{T}\\sum x_{t-1} e_t + \\frac{1}{T}\\sum u_t e_t}{\\frac{1}{T^2}\\sum x_t^2}\n\\]\nwhere\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{1}{T}\\sum x_{t-1} e_t &= \\frac{\\phi}{T}\\sum x_{t-1} u_t + \\frac{\\sqrt{1-\\phi^2}}{T}\\sum x_{t-1} \\eta_t \\\\\n&\\to \\phi\\int W_1 dW_1 + \\sqrt{1-\\phi^2}\\int W_1 dW_2\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nTherefore,\n\\[\nT(\\hat\\beta-\\beta) \\to \\frac{\\phi\\int W_1 dW_1 + \\sqrt{1-\\phi^2}\\int W_1dW_2+\\phi}{\\int W_1^2 dt}.\n\\]\nWhen \\(\\phi\\neq 0\\), that is endogneity exists, the limiting distribution is shifted.

Only stationary regressors converge to Gaussian distribution.\nNow consider a general regression,\n\\[\ny_t = \\boldsymbol{\\beta x_t} + e_t\n\\]\nwhere \\(e_t\\) is stationary. Sims (1990) shows that we can always find a linear combination \\(\\boldsymbol{Dx_t=z_t}\\) that transforms the regression into a canonical form\n\\[\ny_t = \\boldsymbol{\\gamma z_t} + e_t\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\boldsymbol{\\gamma=\\beta D^{-1}}\\). This means, if a component of \\(\\hat\\beta\\) can be written as a linear combination of \\(\\hat\\gamma_1, \\hat\\gamma_3, \\hat\\gamma_4\\), its distribution will be dominated by the behavior of \\(\\hat\\gamma_1\\) due to its slower convergence speed. As such, it will behave like asymptotic normal and converge at speed \\(\\sqrt T\\).\nIn essence, the coefficients that can be represented as a linear combination involving stationary regressors will be asymptotically normal and converge at rate \\(\\sqrt T\\). Consider an example,\n\\[\ny_t = \\alpha + \\rho_1 y_{t-1} + \\rho_2 y_{t-2} + \\beta_1 x_t + \\beta_2 x_{t-1} + e_t\n\\]\nwhere \\(y_t\\) and \\(x_t\\) are \\(I(1)\\).

Hence, all coefficients will have asymptotically normal distributions. Standard inference applies. We verify the claim with a Monte Carlo simulation.\n\nlibrary(dynlm)\nbeta = sapply(1:1000, function(i) {\n  x = arima.sim(list(order=c(1,1,0),ar=.5), 200)\n  y = arima.sim(list(order=c(0,1,1),ma=.7), 200)\n  coef(dynlm(y ~ L(y,1:2) + L(x,0:1)))\n}) |> t() \n{\n  par(mfrow=c(2,2), mar=c(2,2,2,2))\n  hist(beta[,'L(y, 1:2)1'], freq=F, main=\"y(t-1)\")\n  hist(beta[,'L(y, 1:2)2'], freq=F, main=\"y(t-2)\")\n  hist(beta[,'L(x, 0:1)0'], freq=F, main=\"x(t)\")\n  hist(beta[,'L(x, 0:1)1'], freq=F, main=\"x(t-1)\")\n}"
