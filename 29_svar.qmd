# Structural VAR {#sec-svar}

## The Structural Framework

Now we reconsider the problem of estimating structural shocks. We have
introduced the structural shock framework in @sec-ssf the underlying
econometric framework of understanding our economy. To briefly recap, we
envision our economy as an MA process in which multiple structural
shocks are the fundamental driving forces:

$$
y_t =  \Theta(L) \epsilon_t
$$ {#eq-sma}

Structural shocks must be distinguished from innovations or errors in a
regression. Innovations are prediction errors from past observations.
Innovations can be cross-sectionally or serially correlated. Structural
shocks are primitive, unforeseeable, and uncorrelated shocks. We do not
usually observe structural shocks but they are the conceptualized
driving forces in the background. One of the most important task of
econometrics is to uncover the impact of these driving forces.

In the MA representation, if $\Theta(L)$ is invertible, we would have

$$
\Theta^{-1}(L) y_t = \epsilon_t
$$

which is an infinite order AR process. This motivates us to estimate
structural shocks via vector autoregressive processes. If we have a VAR
process:

$$
A(L) y_t = u_t
$$ {#eq-var}

where $u_t = y_t - \text{Proj}(y_t | y_{t-1},y_{t-2},\dots)$ are the
innovations. The question is, to what extend, or under what conditions,
can we identify the structural shocks from this VAR specification?

The answer is easier than you might have thought. We only require

$$
u_t = \Theta_0 \epsilon_t
$$ {#eq-resid}

where $\Theta_0$ is the first coefficient in the lag polynomial. That
is, the condition for identification is that we can find a linear
transformation to decompose $u_t$ into $\epsilon_t$.

## Invertibility

The structural MA process is said to be **invertible** if $\epsilon_t$
can be linearly determined from current and lagged values of $y_t$:

$$
\epsilon_t = \text{Proj}(\epsilon_t| y_t, y_{t-1},\dots).
$$

This means there is no "omitted variable" in the observable space, in
the sense that the space spanned by $\{\epsilon_t, \epsilon_{t-1},...\}$
is fully covered by $\{y_t, y_{t-1},â€¦\}$.

$$
\text{span}\{\epsilon_t,\epsilon_{t-1},...\} =
\text{span}\{y_t, y_{t-1},...\} =
\text{span}\{u_t, u_{t-1},...\}
$$

This is a strong assumption. Under invertibility, the knowledge of the
past true shocks would not even improve the the VAR forecast. But it
does not require our VAR system being exhaustive, including everything
observable variable related to our economy. In a particular application,
we would only be interested in a few structural shocks. The
invertibility condition requires the observables fully cover the space
spanned by the structural shocks of particular concern.

With the above condition satisfied, we can show that the identification
problem is reduced to identify $\Theta_0$. Given @eq-sma and @eq-var, we
have

$$
u_t = A(L)y_t = A(L)\Theta(L)\epsilon_t \overset{?}= \Theta_0 \epsilon_t
$$

By definition of innovation, which are residuals of projections from
past observations:

$$
\begin{aligned}
u_t &= y_t - \text{Proj}[y_t | y_{t-1},y_{t-2},...] \\[1em]
&=\Theta(L)\epsilon_t - \text{Proj}[\Theta(L)\epsilon_t | y_{t-1},y_{t-2},...]\\[1em]
&=\Theta_0\epsilon_t + \Theta_1\epsilon_{t-1} +\cdots+
\text{Proj}[\Theta_0\epsilon_t + \Theta_1\epsilon_{t-1} + \cdots | y_{t-1},y_{t-2},...] \\
&= \Theta_0\epsilon_t - \Theta_0\underbrace{\text{Proj}[\epsilon_t|y_{t-1},...]}_{=0\ \text{by definition}} + \sum_{j=1}^{\infty}\Theta_j\{\epsilon_{t-j} - \underbrace{\text{Proj}[\epsilon_{t-j}|y_{t-1},...]}_{=\epsilon_{t-j}\ \text{by invertibility}}\} \\
&= \Theta_0\epsilon_t.
\end{aligned}
$$

## Assumptions of Structural VAR

1.  All variables are stationary;
2.  The space spanned by the innovations and the structural shocks
    coincide such that $u_t = \Theta_0\epsilon_t$;
3.  The structural process $y_t = \Theta(L)\epsilon_t$ is invertible.

Under the assumptions, identifying $\Theta_0$ is equivalent to identify
the structural shocks $\epsilon_t = \Theta_0^{-1} u_t$.

In essence, structural identification is equivalent to sorting out the
contemporaneously correlated residuals into uncorrelated shocks that can
be attached with economic meanings. As we will see, the decomposition is
largely subjective, according to researchers' understanding on how
structural shocks are correlated contemporaneously.

If the invertibility assumption fails, that means there exists no
mapping from VAR innovations to the structural shocks. Non-invertibility
arises when the observed variables fail to perfectly reveal the state
variables (structural shocks). If this is the case, we can include more
variables to expand the space hopefully to cover the state variables; or
we may choose to simply ignore it if we believe the wedge between VAR
innovations and structural shocks is small.

## Identification

With invertibility, the essential task of SVAR is to decompose @eq-resid
to recover the structural shocks. The key is to estimate $\Theta_0$.
Consider the second-order moments of @eq-resid:

$$
\Theta_0\mathbb{E}(\epsilon_t\epsilon_t')\Theta_0' = \mathbb{E}(u_tu_t')
$$

Estimating the VAR system @eq-var by OLS gives
$\hat\Omega = \mathbb{\hat E}(u_tu_t')$. By definition, elements of
$\epsilon_t$ are orthogonal to each other, so
$D=\mathbb E (\epsilon_t\epsilon_t')$ is diagonal. Estimated
$\hat\Omega$ gives $n(n+1)/2$ distinct values. Identification of $D$
requires $n$ values. So no more than $n(n-1)/2$ parameters in $\Theta_0$
can be identified. That means, we cannot identify an $n\times n$ matrix
$\Theta_0$ without restrictions.

### Recursive restriction

One common way to impose restrictions on $\Theta_0$ is to require it
being lower triangular. Thus eliminating $n(n-1)/2$ entries. We also
assume the structural shocks have the same magnitude as the innovations,
so the diagonal entries are $1$s. For example, in the three variable
Keynesian system, we may assume

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
u_t^\pi \\ u_t^y \\ u_t^m
\end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
* & 1 & 0 \\
* & * & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
\epsilon_t^{S} \\ \epsilon_t^{IS} \\ \epsilon_t^{MP}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

The recursive structure is equivalent to imposing restrictions on the
contemporaneous relationships between variable, or imposing different
reaction speed to the structural shocks. In the above example, we assume
the observed monetary policy (interest rate) responds to IS shock,
supply shock and monetary policy shock contemporaneously; but inflation
and output respond to monetary policy shock with a lag (sluggish
response). Output responds to IS shock and supply shock
contemporaneously, but inflation responds to IS shock with a lag. Of
course, one can question the validity of these assumptions, or even the
validity of the conceptualization of the three structural shocks. But
this is a structural question, not an econometric one. Economists have
always been debating what are the proper structures to describe the
economy.

In the recursive identification scheme, the ordering of the variables is
the vital decision to make. Typically, the slow-moving variables are
ordered first, and the fast-moving variables last, provided the
$\Theta_0$ is upper triangular. In the literature involving monetary
policy, a "slow-r-fast" scheme is widely adopted. That is, low-moving
variables such as real output and price levels are ordered before
interest rates; and fast-moving variables such as financial market
indexes are ordered after interest rates. Because financial market
absorbs information very quickly, even ahead of the monetary policy
decision. But it take time for real variables to materialize the impact
of monetary policy changes.

### Non-recursive restriction

We may also impose non-recursive structure based on theories or
intuitions. Consider a model constituted of the demand and supply of an
agriculture product, and the weather condition that affects the supply
of the product. We assume weather does not depend on market behaviors.
In addition, the supply but not the demand is influenced by the weather.
This results in an identification matrix as follows

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
u_t^d \\ u_t^s \\ u_t^w
\end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & -\beta & 0 \\
1 & -\gamma & -\delta \\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
\epsilon_t^{d} \\ \epsilon_t^{s} \\ \epsilon_t^{w}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Note that there are only three parameters to be estimated in the matrix.
So $\Theta_0$ in this case can also be identified.

Structural VAR literature has invented lots of identification schemes,
such as long-run restrictions, sign restrictions, and so on. These are
left for the readers to explore themselves.
