This book is built by [Quarto](https://quarto.org/).

The `main` branch contains the source code. The `gh-pages` contains the HTML webpages. 

To publish the book to `gh-pages`, switch to the `main` branch, and execute the command:

```console
quarto publish gh-pages
```

The publish command will render the content, copy the output to the `gh-pages` branch, push that branch to GitHub, and then open a browser to view the site once it is deployed.
